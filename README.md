# The effectiveness of marketing activities at local level
## A spatial panel autoregressive model
A spatial panel autoregressive model with fixed effects is developed in order to assess the effectiveness of different marketing activities of a fast-food retail chain at restaurant level. 

Each advertising activity is modeled separately as an adstock variable for each Italian Province, capturing the provincial carryover effect of alternative media on consumers’ decisions. With the adstock variables defined at a Province level, the Advertising Elasticities of each Province of the statistically and economically significant marketing activities, e.g. GRP TV and Euro Spent in other Offline Campaigns, are computed, underlining the effectiveness of different media in the short and long run. Short-term elasticities underline the concurrent effect of marketing activities on the response variables, whereas long-term elasticities take into consideration the additional carryover effect of a marketing activity due to consumer’s memory rate. Furthermore, Advertising Elasticities provide a guideline for future advertising budget allocation for the client on a restaurant level taking into consideration location dependencies and provincial memory rates.
Since no close forms are available for advertising activities modeled by an Adstock variable, the Advertising Elasticities are computed through a simulated procedure based on estimated SEM with Fixed Effects Model. More specifically, long-term Advertising Elasticities are computed by increasing each marketing activity by 1% on the first day (change of total sales/traffic), whereas short-term Advertising Elasticities by increasing the corresponding advertising variable by 1% per day (change in average daily sales/traffic).
In order to capture the effect of alternative advertising media on consumer behavior, additional explanatory variables of Bank
Holidays, Weekends (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) and Sporting Events are taken into consideration as well as daily weather data based on each restaurant's location.

Due to confidential agreement with the client, the initial datasets as well as the newly generated panel dataset are not provided.
