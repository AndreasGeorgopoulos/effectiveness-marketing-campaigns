# The effectiveness of marketing activities at local level
## A spatial panel autoregressive model
A spatial panel autoregressive model with fixed effects is developed in order to assess the effectiveness of different marketing activities of a fast-food retail chain at restaurant level.

 Each advertising activity is modeled separately
as an adstock variable for each Italian Province, capturing the provincial carryover effect of
alternative media on consumers’ decisions. With the adstock variables defined at a Provincelevel,
the Advertising Elasticities of each Province of the statistically and economically
significant marketing activities, e.g. GRP TV and Euro Spent in other Offline Campaigns, are
computed, underlining the effectiveness of different media in the short and long run.


Therefore, in order to capture the effect of
alternative advertising media on consumer behavior, additional explanatory variables of Bank
Holidays, Weekends (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) and Sporting Events are investigated a



Having estimated each Spatial Panel Error Model with Fixed Effects, the Advertising
Elasticities of each Province of the statistically and economically significant marketing
activities, e.g. GRP TV and Euro Spent in other Offline Campaigns, are computed.
Advertising Elasticities underline the effectiveness of different communication campaigns in
the short and long run. Short-term elasticities underline the concurrent effect of marketing
activities on the response variables, whereas long-term elasticities take into consideration the
additional carryover effect of a marketing activity due to consumer’s memory rate.
Furthermore, Advertising Elasticities provide a guideline for future advertising budget
allocation for the client on a restaurant level taking into consideration location dependencies
and provincial memory rates. Given limited alternative advertising media and marketing
budget, in advertising campaigns with higher elasticities a higher budget may be allocated
with respect to the client’s goals at a high-level decision making.
For each Province, both short-term and long-term Advertising Elasticities (of GRP TV
and Euro spent in other Offline Campaigns) are estimated with respect to each response
variable of net sales or total receipts count. Since no close forms are available for advertising
activities modeled by an Adstock variable, the Advertising Elasticities are computed through
a simulated procedure based on estimated SEM with Fixed Effects Model. More specifically,
long-term Advertising Elasticities are computed by increasing each marketing activity by 1%
on the first day (change of total sales/traffic), whereas short-term Advertising Elasticities by
increasing the corresponding advertising variable by 1% per day (change in average daily
sales/traffic).
